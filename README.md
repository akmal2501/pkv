# pkv
a private key-value storage based on gpg and usable as a password manager

## Usage

`pkv edit` can insert, change, delete and display key-value pairs. `pkv get` can
be used to copy the value to the clipboard. `pkv move` changes the key of a key
value pair. `pkv genpw` generates a random password and stores it to a chosen
key.
